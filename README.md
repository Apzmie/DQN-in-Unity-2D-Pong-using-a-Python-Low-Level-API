# DQN-in-Unity-2D-Pong-using-a-Python-Low-Level-API
Unity provides a Python low-level API that allows anyone to apply their own reinforcement learning algorithms to objects. This approach can provide a deep understanding of reinforcement learning implementation without relying on libraries like Gym or Stable-Baselines3. ML-Agents is used only to observe the environment and retrieve observations in Python.

DQN is a foundational reinforcement learning algorithm that was first applied to Atari games. To study DQN in depth, I created a 2D Pong environment in Unity using a Python low-level API. ML-Agents is only used to obtain observations. I used an MLP instead of a CNN to speed up training. Prioritized Experience Replay and Multi-step Learning in Rainbow DQN are used to enhance training of speed, as well. This project is based on the original DQN and Rainbow DQN papers.
unity is the best to reinforce
